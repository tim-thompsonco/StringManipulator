; Description:	This program will request and obtain 10 signed decimal integers from the user.
;				Each number is validated to ensure that it is small enough to fit inside a
;				32 bit register. Once the 10 raw numbers have been inputted and validated, a
;				list of the numbers that the user entered is displayed. The program will then
;				compute the sum of the numbers, and their rounded average, and the results of
;				these computations are then displayed to the user. Finally, a goodbye message
;				is displayed.
